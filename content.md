# Metric vs Imperial

### A Field Guide for the Perpetually Confused

[Conversions](#conversions) · [History](#history) · [FAQ](#faq)
:::

Most of the world uses the **metric system** — a tidy, base-10 design where everything multiplies by 10.
The United States, Myanmar, and Liberia use the **imperial system** — a lovable collection of units with charmingly arbitrary origins.

Neither is *wrong*, exactly. But one of them requires memorizing that 5,280 feet make a mile.

## The Two Systems, Side by Side

### Metric System

- Meters, kilograms, liters
- Powers of 10 everywhere
- Used by ~195 countries
- Required by science worldwide
- Easy to teach children

**Length:** km → m → cm → mm
(just move the decimal point)

**Temperature:**
0°C = water freezes
100°C = water boils
:::

:::warp imperial
### Imperial System

- Feet, pounds, gallons
- Based on historical body parts
- Required in 3 countries
- Deeply embedded in US culture
- Character-building to learn

**Length:** miles → yards → feet → inches
(1 mile = 1,760 yards = 5,280 feet)

**Temperature:**
32°F = water freezes
212°F = water boils

## Common Conversions {#conversions}

| To convert | Formula | Real-world example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| miles → km | × 1.609 | 26.2 mi marathon = **42.2 km** |
| kg → lb | × 2.205 | 70 kg person = **154 lb** |
| °C → °F | × 9/5, then + 32 | 20°C = **68°F** (pleasant spring day) |
| °F → °C | − 32, then × 5/9 | 98.6°F = **37°C** (normal body temp) |
| liters → gallons | × 0.264 | 2 L bottle = **0.53 gal** |
| cm → inches | × 0.394 | 30 cm = **11.8 in** |
| km/h → mph | × 0.621 | 100 km/h = **62 mph** |

### The one you actually need to remember

> **Rough rule:** 1 kg ≈ 2.2 lb · 1 mile ≈ 1.6 km · double °C and add 30 to get °F (close enough)

## A Brief History {#history}

:::details Why does the US still use imperial?
When the US gained independence in 1776, imperial units were already in daily use. The metric system was invented in France in 1795 — *after* the revolution — and the newly independent US had little enthusiasm for adopting a French system.

Congress has technically allowed metric use since 1866, and the US officially signed the Metre Convention in 1875. The Metric Conversion Act of 1975 declared metrication a national goal — but made it **voluntary**. That's why it never happened.

NASA lost the Mars Climate Orbiter in 1999 because one team used metric units and another used imperial. The spacecraft missed Mars orbit by 170 km and burned up in the atmosphere. Total cost: $327 million.

:::details Why is a foot 12 inches?
The foot was literally based on the length of a human foot. The inch derived from the width of a thumb — or, more precisely, three dried barleycorns laid end to end. These units evolved independently across different cultures over centuries, then were standardized to be mutually consistent.

Hence the seemingly arbitrary 12:1 ratio. The metric system, by contrast, was designed from scratch in 1795 to be purely rational.

:::details The 30°C Rule (why weather feels confusing)
30°C sounds hot. And it is — that's 86°F, a warm summer day.
0°C sounds mild-ish. It's not — that's 32°F, freezing point.

The trick: **double the Celsius temperature, then add 30** to get a rough Fahrenheit estimate.
- 20°C → 40 + 30 = **70°F** ✓ (actually 68°F)
- 35°C → 70 + 30 = **100°F** ✓ (actually 95°F)

Good enough for weather conversations.

## FAQ {#faq}

**Which system is better for cooking?**
Metric, by far. Weighing ingredients in grams is far more accurate than measuring cups, which vary by how tightly you pack them. Professional kitchens worldwide use grams.

**Which is better for body temperature?**
Celsius is more intuitive: 37°C is normal, 38°C is a mild fever, 40°C means stay in bed. Fahrenheit's 98.6 normal / 100.4 fever boundary is harder to remember.

**How tall is 6 feet in metric?**
182.88 cm. Round to 183 cm in conversation. NBA players are typically 198–213 cm (6'6"–7'0").

**Why does the UK use both?**
History, stubbornness, and nostalgia. Road distances are in miles. Beer is poured in pints. Body weight is discussed in stone (1 stone = 14 lb = 6.35 kg). Everything else is metric. It's fine.

**Is the metric system actually easier?**
Yes. 1000 m = 1 km. 1000 g = 1 kg. 1000 ml = 1 L. Every prefix (kilo-, centi-, milli-) means the same thing across all units. Children in metric countries learn this in an afternoon.
